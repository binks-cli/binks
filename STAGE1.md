# Binks CLI - Stage 1 Implementation

## Overview

Stage 1 of the Binks CLI implements the foundational command execution functionality for our Go-based DevShell Codex CLI. This stage focuses on creating a minimal, testable CLI that can execute shell commands in the DevShell environment.

## Architecture

The implementation follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns:

```
├── cmd/binks/              # Main CLI application
│   ├── main.go            # Entry point and argument parsing
│   └── main_test.go       # Integration tests for CLI
└── internal/executor/     # Command execution logic
    ├── executor.go        # Executor interface
    ├── bash_executor.go   # Bash-based implementation
    ├── bash_executor_test.go
    ├── mock_executor.go   # Mock implementation for testing
    └── mock_executor_test.go
```

## Key Features

### 1. Command Execution
- **Interface-based design**: The `Executor` interface allows for easy testing and future extensibility
- **Bash integration**: Uses `bash -c` to execute commands, enabling shell features like:
  - Environment variable expansion
  - Wildcards and glob patterns
  - Pipes and redirection
  - Command chaining with `&&` and `||`

### 2. Error Handling
- Proper error propagation from shell commands
- Combined stdout/stderr capture
- Exit code handling
- User-friendly error messages

### 3. Test Coverage
- **Unit tests**: Comprehensive testing of the executor components
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end testing of the CLI binary
- **Mock implementation**: For reliable testing without external dependencies
- **TDD approach**: Tests written first to drive the implementation

## Usage

### Basic Command Execution
```bash
./binks echo "Hello, DevShell!"
./binks ls -la
./binks pwd
```

### Shell Features
```bash
./binks echo "User: $USER"
./binks find . -name "*.go" | head -5
./binks ls /tmp && echo "Success"
```

### Error Handling
```bash
./binks invalidcommand  # Shows error message and exits with code 1
./binks                 # Shows usage message
```

## Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
go test -v ./...
```

Run specific test packages:
```bash
go test ./internal/executor/
go test ./cmd/binks/
```

## Building

Build the binary:
```bash
go build -o binks ./cmd/binks
```

## Implementation Details

### BashExecutor
- Uses `exec.Command("bash", "-c", cmd)` for shell feature support
- Captures combined output (stdout + stderr)
- Trims trailing newlines for cleaner output
- Inherits environment from parent process (DevShell context)

### Error Handling Strategy
- Shell execution errors are preserved and returned
- Exit codes are captured in the error
- Output is still returned even on error (for stderr content)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test the full CLI workflow
- **Mock objects**: Enable testing without external dependencies
- **Temporary directories**: For reliable file system testing

## Future Enhancements (Stage 2+)

This foundation sets up for:
- Interactive REPL mode
- Session management and working directory tracking
- Configuration file support
- Safety heuristics and sandboxing
- AI agent integration

## Compliance

- **TDD approach**: Tests written first, driving implementation
- **Go standards**: Following Go conventions and best practices
- **Interface design**: Clean abstractions for extensibility
- **Error handling**: Proper error propagation and user feedback
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code comments and documentation

## Demo

Run the demo script to see all features in action:
```bash
./demo.sh
```

This demonstrates:
- Basic command execution
- Shell feature support
- Error handling
- Multi-line output
- Environment variable expansion
